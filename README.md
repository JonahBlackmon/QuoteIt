# QuoteIt - Anonymous Aduio Based Social Media App

**QuoteIt** is a real-time social media app I built from the ground up with a focus on anonymity and user expression. It lets users capture and share transcriptions of their recent audio, creating a space where people can post spontaneous thoughts without revealing their identity. Every part of the app—from the UI to the backend—is custom-built, with Firebase handling real-time data and authentication behind the scenes.

## Features

- **Audio Capture & Transcription**  
  Users can turn the last *20 seconds* of audio into a quote seamlessly with the press of a button, allowing them to capture special moments without pausing them.

- **Anonymous Identity System**  
  Every user is given an **autogenerated username** and a **randomized avatar** from a curated pool. This design preserves anonymity while still enabling users to recognize and connect with recurring voices.

- **Explore & Search**  
  A dynamic **Explore page** and **search functionality** make it easy to discover, like, and interact with quotes shared by others—without ever revealing identity.

- **Interaction Without Exposure**  
  Users can **like** and **favorite** quotes to build collections and community.

## Architecture Overview

QuoteIt is structured as a SwiftUI frontend app that interacts with Firebase backend services to enable real-time anonymous audio quoting.

- **Frontend (SwiftUI):**  
  Handles user interface, navigation, and interaction. The UI components use `QuoteManager` and `UserService` to handle interactions with publishing and displaying content across   views.

- **Audio Capture (AVFoundation):**  
  `AudioManager` maintains a rolling buffer of the last 20 seconds of audio, which can be transcribed into text on demand.

- **Backend (Firebase):**  
  Firebase Firestore stores quote data and user interactions (likes, favorites). Authentication uses Firebase's anonymous login system to preserve privacy.

Data flows from the audio buffer through transcription, then to Firestore where quotes are stored and propagated to all users in real time.
