## Features

- **Audio Capture & Transcription**  
  Users can upload transcriptions of the **last 20 seconds of audio**, allowing spontaneous and authentic expression without continuous recording.

- **Anonymous Identity System**  
  Every user is given an **autogenerated username** and a **randomized avatar** from a curated pool. This design preserves anonymity while still enabling users to recognize and connect with recurring voices.

- **Explore & Search**  
  A dynamic **Explore page** and **search functionality** make it easy to discover, like, and interact with quotes shared by othersâ€”without ever revealing identity.

- **Interaction Without Exposure**  
  Users can **like** and **favorite** quotes to build collections and community vibes without the pressure of followers, comments, or profiles.
